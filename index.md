% Challenging American politicians to work for real justice

True Justice has been lacking for too long in America, for too many
people. The African American community especially, but the poor, the
LGBTQ+ community (particularly the Trans portion), Native Americans,
indigenous Hawaiians. Too many communities that don't fit into the
"white America" myth.

In 2020, we are asking politicians to stand for something that matters
to those peoples: Justice. True Justice. Righting the wrongs of the
past by leveling the playing field and giving everyone in America an
equal opportunity.


# The Pledge

I, NAME, do pledge to work towards the following goals and policies:


## Law Enforcement

1. Reduce the police force by 50% by 2024.
1. Use the money saved to dramatically increaee social workers and
   other roles that interact non-violently with the populace.
1. Reduce the prison population by 90% by 2024, through releasing and
   expunging non-violent drug offenders and sex workers.
   -  Other laws that essentially criminalize behavior that could be
      descrived as "self harm" should be replaced by social work
      rather than prison time.
1. External oversight of use of force by police.
1. Expect accountability of police by reducing the scope of "qualified
   immunity", or possibly eliminating it entirely.
   -  We should be holding police to a very high standard.

## Base standard of Living

1. Raise the minimum wage to meet a certain standard of living, and
   index it to inflation.
1. Set a base standard of living we expect everyone in America to
   have, and ensure it can be reached through UBI or an expanded SNAP.
1. Basic, comprehensive healthcare for everyone.
1. School lunch should just be free.


## Science based public policy

1. A commitment to a science-based drug policy.
1. A commitment to a science-based gun policy.
1. Access to necessary data
   - Police records must be available.
   - Gun records must be available (and digitized).
1. Federal funding for tudying gun violence.
   - This really means "unban Federal funding..."
